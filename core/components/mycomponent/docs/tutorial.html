<p>I want to say up front that a great deal of the code in this
    package was written by Shaun McCormick for the build scripts of
    various MODx Revolution components or inspired by Shaun's code.
    Shaun's modExtra package was immensely helpful in the development
    of this package.</p>

<p>This sample build script will build an actual Transport Package
    that can be installed in MODx Revolution. It installs a number of
    useless resources, elements, menus, system settings, and a
    category
    called MyComponent. It also creates language strings for elements
    and for element properties. The elements have properties with
    property descriptions and they're placed in the MyComponent
    category.
    The resources are placed in a resource group called MyComponent.
    The plugins are attached to a couple of system events. In
    addition,
    there is a script that interacts with the user during the install,
    a couple of file resolvers that transfer the assets and core
    directories, and a script resolver that does some final work at
    the end of the install process. There is also a readme.txt file, a
    GPL license file, and a readme.md file for GitHub.</p>

<p>The script is designed so that when you need to create a package,
    you can copy it to a directory and modify it to meet your
    needs.</p>

<p>No build script could do everything you need for every package, but
    this one should handle almost any kind of package you might
    want.</p>

<p>Don't be alarmed by the size and complexity of the script. Most of
    it will go unused in many packages, and it's easy to make the
    script skip things you don't need.</p>

<p>By changing the variables at the top of the build.transport.php
    file, you can customize the build script to include just the
    components you need. Of course you can also delete the files
    and directories you don't need.</p>

<h3>A Proper Transport Package</h3>
<p>In creating a Transport Package, it's not enough to just install
    the various pieces of the component. Even a simple snippet
    will have properties (parameters). Those properties should usually
    be
    installed as default properties of the snippet. The properties
    also
    need descriptions, which should be presented as lexicon strings so
    that they can be translated into other languages. Any messages
    displayed
    by the snippet (e.g., prompts and error messages) should also be
    in the
    form of MODx lexicon strings.</p>

<p>The snippet also needs a namespace with a corresponding namespace
    path so that MODx can find the lexicon strings. In addition, the
    snippet and any other
    parts of the package should be in a separate category named for
    your
    package. The files in the package also need to have appropriate
    comments
    at the top saying who wrote them, what they do, and in the case of
    executable files, a short version of the GPL license.</p>

<p>All that sounds a lot more difficult than it is. The MyComponent
    package
    is designed to make it as easy as possible by providing example
    templates for
    all the files necessary for a proper package and putting them in
    their proper
    places on your site.</p>

<p>The assumption is that you will put the files for any MODx add-ons
    you
    develop under the assets/mycomponents/ directory. When located
    there, MODx
    will leave them alone during site upgrades and they will not
    interfere with
    your component when you install it on the same site. MyComponent,
    which serves
    as an example and a template for each add-on, will be installed in
    the
    assets/mycomponents/mycomponent/ directory. If you develop an
    add-on
    called MySnippet, all of its files would then go in the
    assets/mycomponents/mysnippet/ directory.</p>

<p>Let's take a quick look at the process of developing an add-on
    using MyComponent</p>

<h3>A Brief Overview</h3>
<p>To build a Transport package for a component of your own, you'd
    first copy
    the mycomponent directory, and all the files under it, to a new
    directory under
    assets/mycomponents/ and rename it to match the name of your
    package.</p>

<p>The next step is to paste your own code into the appropriate files
    in the new
    directory, then rename them and edit the build.transport.php file
    (the script that
    actually builds the Transport Package) to meet your needs. You can
    do global
    search-and-replace operations to change the various strings in the
    files, to
    match your name, the package name, your site name, your email,
    etc.</p>

<p>You'll also need to edit the lexicon files to contain the strings
    necessary for your package and edit any validator or resolver
    files if
    you need them for your package. Don't forget to edit the variables
at the top of the resolver file (like the ones in build.transport.php).</p>

<p>When you run build.transport.php, your package will be created in
    the
    core/packages directory of your site. The final step is to submit
    that
    Transport Package .zip file at <a
            href="http://modxcms.com/extras">http://modxcms.com/extras</a>
</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Because the MyComponent package builds a package, it can't be
    installed directly. It would be missing the _build directory and
    it would actually install a number of objects on your site that
    you
    don't want.</p>

<p>Instead, install the GetMyComponent package in Package Manager.
    It will create the the assets/mycomponents directory (a good place
    for all your
    components) and put the mycomponent directory below that. When you
    execute the mycomponent/_build/build.transport.php file, it will
    create a transport package called MyComponent and place it in your
    core/packages directory. Try that first, and then go to Package
    Manager and click on &quot;Add Package&quot; and &quot;Search Locally for
    Packages.&quot;</p>

<p>Try installing the MyComponent package and look around for it's
    various parts. Then try uninstalling it.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>One of the handiest things you can have is a code editor that will
    do multi-file search and replace. You can use that to change
    MyComponent to the name of your package (but don't do it yet).</p>

<p>It's particularly handy to have a code editor that will &quot;refactor&quot;
    for you. Both NetBeans and JetBrain's PhpStorm will do this. If
    you right-click on a file and select refactor -> rename, you can
    change the name of the file and the editor will search for all
    references to that file in your project and rename them to match.
    Always do this before editing the file content.</p>

<p>Most of the components in the MyComponent package have names like
    &quot;mychunk1.chunk.tpl,&quot; &quot;mysnippet1.snippet.php,&quot;
    &quot;myplugin1.events.php,&quot;
    &quot;properties.mysnippet1.php,&quot; etc. You can refactor these to use
    the appropriate names for your components and the references to
    them in the various files of the project will change to match. If
    you
    do the search-and-replace operations and the refactoring in the
    order
    specified later in this tutorial, you should have very little work
    left to finish naming everything in the package.</p>

<p>Rather than replacing the existing files with your own, it's almost
    always better to paste your own code into the files or edit them
    to meet your needs. That way, the PhpDoc comments at the top
    of the files will be correct and any necessary GPL license language
    will be there as well.
</p>

<h3>Starting a New Package</h3>

<p>It's recommended that you not change anything in the mycomponent
    directory, with the exception of the changes you want in all
    your packages, e.g., author names, URLs, email addresses,
    copyright
    notices, etc. Don't change MyComponent.</p>

<p>Once you've made those changes, it's not a bad idea to make it read
    only so that you won't modify anything by accident. It's easy to
    get confused about where you're working or to accidentally run
    search-and-replace or refactor on too many files.
    Another good way to protect it is to just put it in a
    safe place, far away from your development directory or in a .zip
    file.</p>

<p>Start by copying the whole mycomponent directory (or just the parts
    of it you need) to a new directory (with a new name) under the
    assets/mycomponents directory. Name the directory for your
    package.
    If you want a package called &quot;BobsPackage,&quot; for example, you'd
    create
    a directory under assets/mycomponents called bobspackage,
    containing
    the _build, core, and assets directories and the readme.md
    file.</p>
    <p>Rename the two mycomponent directories inside your package: core/components/mycomponent and assets/components/mycomponent. Use lowercase names. You'll have to modify the references in the _build/build.transport.php file to match the changes.</p>

<h3>Do the Renaming and Refactoring</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Start by changing the language string prefix in the language
        files
        with search-and-replace. All the language strings have the mc_
        prefix
        (mc for my component). Change that to an appropriate prefix
        for your
        package. You could use the full name of your package to make
        sure
        there won't be collisions with MODx strings and those of other
        packages.
    </li>

    <li>
        If you didn't do so earlier, do a search-and-replace for Your
        Name
        and replace it with your actual name. Then search for
        http://bobsguides/com
        and replace it with your email address. Search for
        YourGitHubUserName
        and replace it with your GitHub username (if any).
    </li>

    <li>
        Refactor the file names. Change the name of all the elements
        and resources to the names you want to use in your package.
        Watch
        what's happening to make sure that nothing outside your
        package
        is changed. If you're using PhpStorm, be sure to check the
        options
        to search for references and to look in comments and strings.
        Change
        any property file names.
    </li>

    <li>
        Search-and-replace Operations
        <ol>
            <li>Do a case-sensitive global search-and-replace to
                change mycomponent
                to the lowercase name of your package.</li>
            <li>Do another case-sensitive search-and-replace to change
                MyComponent to the camel-case name of
                your component.</li>
            <li>Search for 1/1/11 and change it to the current
                date.</li>
            <li>Search for 2011 and replace it with the current
                year.</li>
            <li>Search for yoursite.com and change it to the domain
                name of your site.</li>
            <li>Check the file paths in the
                _build/data/transport.*.php files.</li>
            <li>Search for Description and add a description for each
                file.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Check the lines that refer to other files in the build.transport.php
    file, and the transport.*.php files to makes sure they match the
    renamed files.</li>
    <li>
        Look through the files to see if anything was missed. In most
        cases,
        you'll get a warning during the build for any path or filename
        references
        that are not correct.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rewrite the readme.txt file. If you use GitHub, rewrite the
        readme.md file. It's in MarkDown format, use the tool at
        <a href = "http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus">http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus</a>
        to get it to look right before pushing to GitHub. Paste the text of the
        file into the input section at the to and click on the
        &quot;Convert&quot; button. Scroll down to the bottom to see the
        rendered version of the text. If it doesn't look right (and it probably won't),
        edit the text at the top and try again until it looks good, then
        paste it back into your readme.md file.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuring the Build</h3>

<p>Edit the variables at the top of _build/build.transport.php to
    set the package name and version and to eliminate the components
    that your package doesn't have. You can delete the unwanted files
    and directories, or you can leave them there in case your package
    gets more complicated in the future. As long as the variables
    are set to false, the script will ignore them and they won't be
    placed in the package. Edit the variables
    at the top of _build/resolvers/install.script.php to meet your
    needs.</p>
<p>Here is the list of the variables that you'll need to set:</p>
<ul>
    <li>define('PKG_NAME','MyComponent');</li>
    <li>define('PKG_NAME_LOWER','mycomponent');</li>
    <li>define('PKG_VERSION','1.0.0');</li>
    <li>define('PKG_RELEASE','beta1');</li>
    <li>define('PKG_CATEGORY','MyComponent');</li>
    <br />
    <li>$hasAssets = true; /* Transfer the files in the assets dir.
        */</li>
    <li>$hasCore = true; /* Transfer the files in the core dir.
        */</li>
    <li>$hasSnippets = true;</li>
    <li>$hasChunks = true;</li>
    <li>$hasTemplates = true;</li>
    <li>$hasResources = true;</li>
    <li>$hasValidator = true; /* Run a validator before installing
        anything */</li>
    <li>$hasResolver = true; /* Run a resolver after installing
        everything */</li>
    <li>$hasSetupOptions = true; /* HTML/PHP script to interact with
        user */</li>
    <li>$hasMenu = true; /* Add items to the MODx Top Menu */</li>
    <li>$hasSettings = true; /* Add new MODx System Settings */</li>
    <li>$hasTemplateVariables = true;</li>
    <li>$hasTemplates = true;</li>
    <li>$hasPlugins = true;</li>
    <li>$hasPluginEvents = true;</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that if you want to connect Template Variables to their
    templates or connect plugin events to their plugins, you'll do
    that in a resolver (see _build/resolvers/install.script.php).</p>

<h3>Plug In Your Code</h3>

<p>Paste your plugin, template, snippet, resource content, chunk
    content, etc. into the appropriate files. After you change each
    file,
    edit the related _build/data file(s) and lexicon files to
    match.</p>

<p>After pasting your snippet code into the *.snippet.php file, for
    example, edit the _build/transport.snippets/php file to set
    the snippet name and the other snippet fields. Put the appropriate
    language strings into the core/lexicon/en/default.inc.php file.
    If your snippet (or other element) has default properties, edit
    the
    appropriate _build/properties file and then add the property strings to
    the core/lexicon/en/properties.inc.php file.</p>

<p>Put any class files in the core/model/mycomponent/ directory and
    make sure the references to them in any plugin or snippet code
    are correct. The correct reference would be something like:</p>
<pre>
MODX_CORE_PATH . components/mycomponents/model/mycomponents/myclass.class.php
</pre>

<p>Edit the transport scripts in the _build/data directory to remove
    the sections for items you don't need, correct the fields for
    your elements and resources (if any), and correct the paths to
    the elements.</p>

<p>Validators run before the package components have been installed.
    They're often used to test for necessary items for your package
    to run (e.g., a graphics library or another installed element
    your package uses, such as getResources).
    If you need a validator, edit the code in
    _build/validators/preinstall.script.php to meet your needs.</p>

<p>Resolvers run after the package components have been installed.
    They
    perform operations that aren't done in the install, such as
    connecting TVs to their templates, connecting plugin events to
    their plugins, setting the values of existing System Settings,
    setting
    System Settings or properties that depend on the the IDs of
    installed
    elements or resources (which aren't available during the install),
    etc.
    If you need a script resolver, edit the code in
    _build/resolvers/install.script.php to meet your needs.</p>

<p>Do a global search for Description and edit the description of
    each item.</p>

<h3>Run the Build Script</h3>

<p>Execute the _build/build.transport.php script either in your editor
    or from the command line. You should see warnings and errors about
    anything that is not correct. Fix those.</p>

<h3>Install the Package</h3>

<p>The package will be placed in the core/packages directory (the one
    for the main MODx install, not the one in your package).</p>

<p>There is a potential source of confusion here. Let's say your
    package
    is called yourcomponent. If you install your package in the same
    install
    of MODx that contains your _build directory, you'll have duplicate
    files in</p>
<pre>
    assets/mycomponents/yourcomponent/assets/yourcomponent
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>
    assets/yourcomponent
</pre>
<p>as well as</p>
<pre>
    core/mycomponents/yourcomponent/core/yourcomponent
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>
    core/yourcomponent
</pre>

<p>There's no harm in this, but it's easy to get confused and edit
    the wrong file when you're working on the package. One solution
    is to install the package a completely separate MODx installation.
    The other solution is to be really careful about where you are
    when
    working on the package.</p>

<p>To install the package, once the transport .zip file has been
    copied
    to the core/packages directory, go to Package Manager and click on
    &quot;Add Package&quot; and &quot;Search
    Locally for Packages.&quot; You should see your package in the grid.
    Install it and then check to make sure it's all there. Check the
    assets/components/yourcomponent and core/components/yourcomponent
    directories to make sure the files were transferred.</p>

<p>If you have to modify the build script or any files in the package,
    uninstall and remove (force removal) your package. Then you can
    run
    the build again, copy the .zip file, and try reinstalling.</p>

<h3>Running Your Component</h3>

<p>If you install your component it should run. If you need to
    make changes to any parts of it, remember that those changes
    won't show up when you run it until you uninstall, rebuild, and
    reinstall because MODx is running the version you installed,
    not the version you are building.</p>

<p>There's a way around that, thanks to a method developed by
    Shaun McCormick, but you have to remember what you're doing or
    it's easy to get confused.</p>

<p>If you would like to actually run the code for plugins and snippets
    that your build script is packaging, you can create new System
    Settings with the paths and URLs for that version. Then in the
    code
    of your snippets and plugins, get that path with a line like
    this:</p>
<pre>
    $path = $modx->getOption('mc.core_path',null,
        $modx->getOption('core_path').'components/yourcomponent/');
</pre>
<p>If, for example, you set the mc.core_path system setting to:</p>
<pre>
{assets_path}components/yourcomponent/core/components/yourcomponent/
</pre>
<p>You can load your class file in the snippet with code like
    this:</p>
<pre>
$iFile = $path . "model/yourcomponent/yourclass.inc.php";
require_once $iFile;
</pre>
<p>For you, the path will resolve to the area with your build script.
    For others who install the package, however, the system setting
    will come back empty, so the path will resolve to that of the
    installed component.</p>

<p>You can also replace the snippet and plugin code with something
    like this:</p>
<pre>
    return include $modx->getOption('mc.core_path') .
        'core/components/yourcomponent/elements/snippets/yoursnippet.snippet.php';
</pre>
<p>If you do this, however, don't forget that you are running off
    the build files. If any files are missing or mis-referenced in the
    build script, you won't know about it until you run your
    component in a MODx install that doesn't have the system
    settings.</p>

<p>If that's all too confusing, just skip it and remember to
    uninstall,
    build, and install your package each time you make a change.</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Package</h3>
<p>As we said earlier, when you run build.transport.php the Transport
    Package
    .zip file will be created in your site's core/packages directory.
    The final step
    is to submit that .zip file at <a
            href="http://modxcms.com/extras">http://modxcms.com/extras</a>.
    You'll need to log in and then click on the &quot;submit a new extra&quot;
    link.</p>

<p>
    Be sure to fill in all the appropriate sections of the submission
    form and designate the
    file you attach as a Transport Package. If you have installed the
    package on
    your site, there will also be another file with the same name, but
    without
    the .zip extension. Be sure to submit the .zip file rather than
    the other file.
</p>
