<p>Much of the code in this package was inspired by Shaun McCormick's
build scripts for various MODX Revolution components and by the structure
of the MODX Package Manager code.

    <h3>MyComponent 3.0</h3>

    <p>
    MyComponent 3.0 is a much more powerful and convenient version. It installs in a
    different location and uses very different methods than older versions. The best approach
    to upgrading is to uninstall and remove all previous versions before installing 3.0 or newer versions.</p>

    <p>
    The newer versions will require no cut-and-paste operations and no tedious file
    or directory renaming. The only manual operation required is
    editing the project config. file.
    </p>

    <p>Here are just some features of the new version</p>

    <p>Based on the objects described in the project config. file,
    the new version will: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Bootstrap</b>

            <ul>
                <li>Create all listed objects in MODX</li>
                <li>Create all connections between listed objects (e.g., resources/templates, plugins/events,etc.)</li>
                <li>Add license and header information to all PHP and JS files</li>
                <li>Create the build.transport.php file</li>
                <li>Create code/content files for all objects, to be used in the build </li>
                <li>optionally, make elements static and connect them to their files</li>
                <li>Create core and assets directories and subdirectories</li>
                <li>Create any listed lexicon files</li>
                <li>Write all transport files for the build</li>
                <li>Write all resolver files to connect objects</li>
                <li>Optionally, write skeleton generic resolvers and validators</li>
                <li>Create skeleton class files for all classes</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>ExportObjects</b>

            <ul>
                <li>Find all of the component's objects in MODX</li>
                <li>Create/update code/content files for objects that need one</li>

                <li>if not, display lexicon string code for pasting</li>
                <li>Audit lexicon files and code files for missing or unused lexicon strings</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>CheckProperties</b>

            <ul>

                <li>Report missing or unused properties</li>
                <li>Display code to paste in property file for missing properties</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
</div>

<h2>A Proper Transport Package</h2>

<p>In creating a Transport Package, it's not enough to just install
the various pieces of the component. Even a simple snippet
may have properties. Those properties should usually be
installed as default properties of the snippet. The properties
also need descriptions, which should be presented as lexicon strings so
that they can be translated into other languages. Any messages
displayed by the snippet (e.g., prompts and error messages) should also be
in the form of MODX lexicon strings.</p>

<p>The snippet also needs a namespace with a corresponding namespace
path so that MODX can find the lexicon strings. In addition, the
snippet and any other parts of the package should be in a separate category named for
your package. The files in the package also need to have appropriate
comments at the top saying who wrote them, what they do, and in the case of
executable files, a short version of the GPL license.</p>

<p>All that sounds a lot more difficult than it is. The MyComponent
package is designed to make it as easy as possible by doing most of the work for you.</p>

<p>MyComponent assumes that you will put the files for any MODX add-ons
you develop under the assets/mycomponents/ directory. When located there, MODX
will leave them alone during site upgrades and they will not interfere with
your component when you install it on the same site. (MyComponent itself, will be installed in
the core/components/mycomponent/ directory.) If you develop an
add-on called MySnippet, all of its files would then go in the
assets/mycomponents/mysnippet/ directory.</p>

<p>Because of the complexity of the process of creating an extra for MODX Revolution, MyComponent sounds about 10 times as complicated as it is. Please don't be scared off by how difficult this all sounds. MyComponent is actually *very* easy to use once you get used to it. It will let you create a transport package for your extra in a fraction of the time it would take you to do it all manually, so it's well worth the effort to learn how to use MyComponent.</p>


<h2>General Usage</h2>

    <p>MyComponent can be used in a variety of ways, but the basic process is to create a new project (either in the UI, or by manually creating a new project config. file and editing the current.project.php file). Once the new project exists, you edit the project config. file to meet your needs and run Bootstrap to get things started. After that, you either finish your project in the MODX Manager and run ExportObjects, or finish it by editing the files in your favorite editor and run ImportObjects (or some combination of those two processes). LexiconHelper writes your Lexicon files and CheckProperties makes sure any properties you use are present in your properties file. Finally, you run the Build utility to create the actual transport package.</p>

    <h2>Example Project</h2>
    <p>MyComponent installs with a built-in project called Example that you can play with to get familiar with the various MyComponent utilities. The utilities can be run from the command line, or from inside any good code editor. There is also a User Interface for them that you can see by viewing the &quot;MyComponent&quot; Resource (which executes the MyComponent snippet). The rest of this tutorial will assume that you're using the User Interface, but the principles are the same for the command-line utilities. The command-line utility files are in the <fixedpre>core/components/mycomponent/elements/snippets/</fixedpre> directory</p>

    <p>If you view the MyComponent Resource in the front end, you'll see a set of radio buttons, one for each of the MyComponent utilities, and a Submit button for executing them. Note that as a security precaution, you must be logged in to the Manager in order to use any of the utilities. When you run any of the utilities, a log of the results will appear below the form. You may have to scroll down to see it.</p>

    <h3>The Project Config. File</h3>

    <p>Every project used with MyComponent must have its own project config. file. The file is always named for the lowercase package name of your Extra (<fixedpre>packageNameLower.config.php</fixedpre>). The files are always stored in the <fixedpre> core/components/mycomponent/_build/config</fixedpre> directory. The file for the Example project is called <fixedpre>example.config.php</fixedpre>. If you look at it now, you'll see all the objects that are part of that package.</p>

    <h2>MyComponent Utilities</h2>

    <p>The basic utilities in the MyComponent package are Bootstrap, ExportObjects, ImportObjects, LexiconHelper, CheckProperties, and Build. Each one plays a separate role in the creation of a transport package.</p>

<p>Basically, Bootstrap gets things off the ground by creating the files, directories, and MODX objects needed for your extra. Bootstrap can also be used to add additional objects you discover you need at any point in a project.

<p>ExportObjects creates code files and build files based on the project as it exists in the MODX Manager.</p>

<p>ImportObjects updated the objects in the Manager based on changes in their code files.</p>

<p>LexiconHelper writes your Lexicon Files for you and checks to make sure that there are no empty, missing, or unused lexicon strings.</p>

<p>CheckProperties looks for references to default properties of elements in code and produces code to be pasted in to the properties file for the build.</p>

<p>Build creates the actual transport package .zip file.</p>

<p>Let's look at the utilities in more detail.</p>

    <h3>Bootstrap</h3>

    <p>The Bootstrap utility should always be run at the beginning of any new project, but only after editing the project config. file to meet your needs. Bootstrap creates the necessary files and directories for your project and also creates the MODX objects (e.g., snippets, chunks, etc.) specified in the project config. file.</p>

    <p>Bootstrap is completely non-destructive. It will not overwrite any existing MODX objects or their code files (though it will update some specific build files). You can re-run Bootstrap at any time during the development of your extra. The usual reason for doing this is discovering that you need another object (a new snippet, chunk, resource, template, etc.) for your project. Add the new object to the project config. file and run Bootstrap. MyComponent will create the new object and any necessary files for it to be included in the build.</p>

    <p>It's important to keep your project config. file up-to-date with all objects used in your project.</p>

    <p>For a first look, view the MyComponent Resource from the Manager. With the current package set to Example, check the Bootstrap radio
    button in the UI and click on the Submit button. If you scroll down, you should see a log of all the actions performed by the Bootstrap
    utility.</p>

    <p>Follow up by looking at the directories and files created by Bootstrap. They will be in the
    <fixedpre>assets/mycomponents/example/</fixedpre>
    directory. All MyComponent projects will be placed in
    <fixedpre>assets/mycomponents/</fixedpre>
    unless you specify a different target directory in the project config. file (not recommended).</p>

    <p>You may notice that a copy of the project config. file is placed in the project directory. This is a copy used by the build process,
    but it's not the real project config. file and you should never edit it. It is ignored by all the other MyComponent utilities. The real
    project config. file (the one used by MyComponent) is always in the
    <fixedpre>core/components/mycomponent/_build/config/</fixedpre>
    directory.</p>

    <p>Once you've looked at all the files and directories created by Bootstrap, go back the the MODX Manager and look at the objects
    created. You should see all the objects specified in the Example project config. file. Notice too that the project config. file specifies
    a number of characteristics of some of the objects (e.g., parent, template, category, etc.). You should see these relationships in the
    Manager as well.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p>There are a lot of things you don't have to worry about with MyComponent. It puts all files in the proper locations and gives them standard names. All relationships between objects are handled automatically. Resources get the proper Templates. TVs are attached to the proper Templates. Plugins are attached to their events. Property Sets are attached to Elements. Elements get put in the proper categories. MyComponent handles this all automatically behind the scenes. Unless you're doing something very exotic, you should never have to directly edit a transport or build file (though you can if you want to).</p>
</div>

    <h3>ExportObjects</h3>
    <p>This utility creates code and build files for all the objects in your project based on the objects that exist in the MODX Manager. It will only process the objects listed in the <fixedpre>'process'</fixedpre> member of the array in the project config. file. </p>

    <p>While Bootstrap uses the project config. file to decide which objects and files to create, ExportObjects (with one exception) uses the categories and namespaces of the actual objects. The exception is Resources. Since there is no way for MyComponent to know which Resources belong to your project, it uses the <fixedpre>'exportResources'</fixedpre> member in the project config. file.</p>

    <p>If any exported elements have default properties, ExportObjects will automatically create a properties file that will be used in the build to transport the properties.</p>

    <p>Unlike Bootstrap, ExportObjects will overwrite the code files for any objects that are processed unless the <fixedpre>'dryRun'</fixedpre> member of the project config. file is set to <fixedpre>true</fixedpre>. If that's the case, ExportObjects will report what files it would be changing without actually changing them.</p>

    <p>The main function of ExportObjects is to let you create or modify MODX objects in the Manager, test them, then export them to files for the build phase of package creation. ExportObjects will not only update the code files for elements and resources, it will also create or update *all* the necessary files for making a transport package for your project.

<p>You should always run Bootstrap at least once after editing the project config. file (and before running ExportObjects for the first time). It's also a good practice to run ExportObjects as a last step before running Build.</p>

<h3>ImportObjects</h3>

    <p>As you might guess, this is the opposite of ExportObjects, though it's use is more limited. ImportObjects updates any elements in MODX based on the code files on the disk. If you make changes to a snippet's code file, you can use ImportObjects to update the snippet. ImportObjects will only process the elements listed in the <fixedpre>'process'</fixedpre> member of the project config. file and it only processes elements that exist in the <fixedpre>'elements'</fixedpre> member.</p>

    <p>One common use of ImportObjects is to update elements in MODX after LexiconHelper has modified the language strings in the files.</p>

    <h3>LexiconHelper</h3>

    <p>LexiconHelper will create your lexicon files for you (no, really). To get the full benefit of LexiconHelper, you need to put your lexicon strings in this form:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
'lexicon_key~~Actual Lexicon string'
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>For example, you might have this in the code of a snippet:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
$message = $modx->lexicon('mc_file_nf~~File Not Found');
</fixedpre></pre>

        <p>Or you might have this language tag in a resource of chunk:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
[[%mc_file_nf~~File Not Found]]
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>LexiconHelper will find all instances where you use the MODX Lexicon. It will create a language string and write it into the appropriate lexicon file for you (and optionally remove the part after the ~~ from the file). The only case where this will fail is if you have a file that uses more than one lexicon topic. If that's the case, LexiconHelper doesn't know which file to write the various language strings to. In that case LexiconHelper outputs the lexicon strings to the screen so you can paste them into the appropriate files.</p>

<p>Whether LexiconHelper modifies the lexicon files and removes the ~~ and it's following string from the code files depend on the following two settings in the project config. file:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
rewriteLexiconFiles
rewriteCodeFiles
</fixedpre></pre>


<p>By default the first one is true and the second one is false. Generally, you want to run LexiconHelper as the last step before doing the final build. I usually leave <fixedpre>rewriteCodeFiles</fixedpre> off until the very end of a project.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p>Important warning! If any of your $modx->lexicon() calles is malformed, rewriteCodeFiles can trash some of your code. Always back up all your code files, including any properties files (preferably with Git) before running LexiconHelper with rewriteCodeFiles = true.</p>
</div>

<p>If your project doesn't have any lexicon strings (e.g., a simple utility snippet or plugin), you can skip using LexiconHelper altogether.</p>

<h3>CheckProperties</h3>
        <p>This utility looks for cases in code where you use a default property. It checks any usages against the properties file(s) in the project's <fixedpre>_build</fixedpre> directory. CheckProperties uses the <fixedpre>'scriptPropertiesAliases'</fixedpre> member near the end of the project config. file to tell it how to find usages. It already knows about most common aliases for the <fixedpre>$scriptProperties</fixedpre> array, but feel free to add ones you use if they're not there already.</p>

<p>If none of your elements have default properties, you can skip using this utility.</p>

        <h3>Build</h3>
<p>If your package is going to be distributed to the public, the final step is to submit your
Transport Package .zip file at <a
        href="http://modx.com/extras">http://modx.com/extras</a>
</p>

        <p>Of course, you'll need a transport.zip file first. That's the job of the Build utility. Build runs the <fixedpre>build.transport.php</fixedpre> file which actually creates the .zip file. The
        <fixedpre>build.transport.php</fixedpre> file is universal (or almost universal). It examines the <fixedpre>_build</fixedpre> directory for your project and creates a package based on the files it finds. At present, it will not handle users or permission-related objects, but will do just about anything else (see the <fixedpre>example.config.php</fixedpre> file for examples of what it *will* handle).</p>


<h2>Customizing MyComponent</h2>
        Any of the Tpl chunks used by MyComponent (as well as the <fixedpre>example.config.php</fixedpre> file) can be customized. Rather than modifying the chunks (or files) directly, you should duplicate them and prefix the name with 'my' so your changes will survive upgrades to MyComponent.</p>

    <h3>Customizing the Tpl chunks</h3>
    <p>If you'd like to modify any of the MyComponent Tpl chunks, duplicate them and prefix the name with &quot;my&quot;. MyComponent will always look first for the prefixed version before using the default chunk or file. Here is the search order for the various Tpl chunks/files (the files are in the <fixedpre>core/components/mycomponent/elements/chunks</fixedpre> directory):</p>

<pre>
<fixedpre>my . name</fixedpre> (chunk)
<fixedpre>my . name</fixedpre> (file)
<fixedpre>name</fixedpre> (chunk)
<fixedpre>name</fixedpre> (file)
</pre>

    <p>Each chunk in the MyComponent category is duplicated as a file in the chunks directory mentioned above. If you prefer to work with the files, simply delete or rename the chunks in the MODX Manager and MyComponent will use the files in the chunks directory.</p>


    <p>The first chunk you'll want to modify is the <fixedpre>example.config.php</fixedpre> chunk. Duplicate it and call the chunk <fixedpre>myexample.config.php</fixedpre>. There are two important things to remember when editing the file. First, the file is mainly a large PHP array and it must be valid PHP in order for MyComponent to function. Use a good code editor and edit carefully. Second, do *not* change the word Example anywhere &mdash; it's necessary for the file to work properly as a template for new projects.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that the <fixedpre>example.config.php</fixedpre> file is a template for all future project config. files. When you create a new project, the <fixedpre>example.config.php</fixedpre> file will be your starting point. You edit it to meet the needs of whatever project you are currently working on *after* you create the new project in the UI. Once you have it the way you want it, you should never need to edit it again.</p>

    <p>What you mainly want to change is the personal information at the top of the file (e.g., your email address, web site, etc.). You may also want to remove some of the example objects (especially the second category) if you're sure that you will never need them. You'll always have the original <fixedpre>example.config.php</fixedpre> file to refer to. </p>

    <h2>Workflows</h2>

    <p>MyComponent is designed to work with a variety of workflows. The odds are good that no matter how you prefer to work, MyComponent will make your life easier. These workflows assume that you have created a duplicate of the <fixedpre>example.config.php</fixedpre> Tpl chunk (or file) called <fixedpre>myexample.config.php</fixedpre> and modified the information at the top of it to include your information. Important: Do *not* change the word &quot;Example&quot; anywhere in the file. When you create a new project, all instances of &quot;Example&quot; will automatically be changed for you. Keep in mind that this config. file is a template for *all* projects, not just your current one, so it should not be modified for any specific project.</p>

    <h3>New Project</h3>
    <p>If your component is new, the process is very simple. In the UI, type the name of your new project in the form fields next to the &quot;New Project&quot; button, then click on the button.<p>

    <p>What happens when you click on the &quot;New Project&quot; button?  MyComponent creates a copy of the <fixedpre>example.config.php</fixedpre> Tpl chunk (or, more likely, the <fixedpre>
    myexample.config.php</fixedpre> Tpl chunk) and places it in the MyComponent <fixedpre>
    _build/config</fixedpre> directory. It renames the file after your new project and replaces all instances of the word &quot;example&quot; with the case-appropriate name of your project.</p>

    <p>Once that has occurred, you can edit the new file (<fixedpre>projectName.config.php</fixedpre>) to meet the needs of your project and then run Bootstrap. Comments in the project config. file will (hopefully) tell you all you need to know about the various members. You can generally delete any object types that you don't need in your project. Note that all config. files are a single large PHP array. They must contain valid PHP code in order for MyComponent to run, so using a good code editor such as PhpStorm can be really helpful.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <p>Although there is a copy of your project config. file in your project directory, you should never edit that file. Most of it is ignored by the MyComponent utilities. The &quot;official&quot; project config. file is the one in the <fixedpre>core/components/mycomponent/_build/config</fixedpre> directory and that's always the one you should modify.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Once you're finished editing the project config. file, you can run Bootstrap and all your Resources, Elements, and other objects and all necessary files for the project will be created for you. You can work on them in the Manager until you get things working the way you want. Once the component is finished, you can run ExportObjects, LexiconHelper, and Build and your Extra will be ready to release.</p>

        <p>Note that any time you discover that your project needs another object, you can add it to the project config. file and re-run Bootstrap. Bootstrap will not modify any existing files or objects, so it's always safe to do this and it's a good practice because it keeps your config. file current.</p>

    <h3>Existing Project</h3>

    <p>If your finished component already exists in MODX and the files are in the proper directories, you can edit the project config. file and run Bootstrap, ExportObjects, LexiconHelper, and Build and your extra will be ready to release.</p>

    <p>It's important that the files be in the proper locations and named properly so that MyComponent can find them. The easiest way to see where things go is to run Bootstrap on the Example project and look at the <fixedpre>assets/mycomponents/example/</fixedpre> directory.</p>

    <p>Normally, MyComponent uses standard naming conventions for all element code files:</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
snippet1.snippet.php
plugin1.plugin.php
template1.template.html
chunk1.chunk.html
</fixedpre></pre>

    <p>For a new project, Bootstrap will create the files using this standard naming convention.</p>
    <p>For an existing project, you can rename your files to match the format above, or you can specify the filename as a field for any element in the project config. file (see the examples in example.config.php) if your file names don't match the standard.
    </p>

<h3>Install the Package</h3>

<p>Once you have run the Build utility, the transport.zip file will be in the core/packages directory (the one for the main MODX install). If you go to System | Package Management in the MODX Manager and select &quot;Search Locally for Packages,&quot; your extra should show up in the grid where it can be installed like any other package. You may not want to do this, however.</p>

<p>There is a potential source of confusion here. Let's say your
package is called yourcomponent. If you install your package in the same
install of MODX that contains your _build directory, you'll have duplicate
files in</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
assets/mycomponents/yourcomponent/assets/yourcomponent
</fixedpre></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
assets/yourcomponent
</fixedpre></pre>
<p>as well as</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
core/mycomponents/yourcomponent/core/yourcomponent
</fixedpre></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
    core/yourcomponent
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>It's easy to get confused and edit the wrong file when you're working on the package. In addition, the objects created by Bootstrap or ImportObjects already exist in the Manager so you won't know whether they were installed by your packages or were already there.</p>

<p>Often, the safest and best solution is to install the package a completely separate MODX installation. To do that, just copy the transport.zip file for your extra from the <fixedpre>core/packages</fixedpre> directory to the <fixedpre>core/packages</fixedpre> directory of the other MODX install. Then, in Package Manager, search locally for packages and install the package as usual. Even if you don't do this during development, you should do it at least once before releasing the package to make sure that it installs and runs as it should.</p>


<h3>Running Your Component</h3>

<p>If you install your component it should run. If you need to make changes to any parts of it, remember that those changes won't show up when you run it until you uninstall, rebuild, and reinstall because MODX is running the version you installed, not the version you are building.</p>

<p>There's a way around that, thanks to a method developed by Shaun McCormick, but you have to remember what you're doing or it's easy to get confused.</p>

<p>If you would like to actually run the code for plugins and snippets that your build script is packaging, you can create new System Settings with the paths and URLs for that version. Then in the
code of your snippets and plugins, get that path with a line like this (this example has &quot;mc.&quot; as a prefix &mdash; you would use your own prefix):</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
$path = $MODX->getOption('mc.core_path',null,
    $MODX->getOption('core_path').'components/yourcomponent/');
</fixedpre></pre>
<p>If, for example, you set the mc.core_path system setting to:</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
{assets_path}components/yourcomponent/core/components/yourcomponent/
</fixedpre></pre>
<p>You can load your class file in the snippet with code like
this:</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
$iFile = $path . "model/yourcomponent/yourclass.inc.php";
require_once $iFile;
</fixedpre></pre>
<p>For you, the path will resolve to the area with your build script. For others who install the package, however, the system setting will come back empty (because it doesn't exist), so the path will resolve to that of the installed component.</p>

<p>You can also replace the snippet and plugin code with something like this:</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
return include $MODX->getOption('mc.core_path') .
    'core/components/yourcomponent/elements/snippets/yoursnippet.snippet.php';
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>Of course another method is to use static elements, though I generally don't recommend doing that. Any class files will be loaded from the installed location in core/packages but the snippets and plugins will come from your build location. That can be very confusing. It's also very easy to forget what you're doing and lose work with static elements.</p>


<p>If you use any of these techniques, don't forget that you are running off the build files. If any files are missing or mis-referenced in the build script, you won't know about it until you run your component in a MODX install that doesn't have the system settings.</p>

<p>If that's all too confusing, just skip it and remember to uninstall, build, and install your package each time you make a change.</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Package</h3>
<p>As we said earlier, when you run build.transport.php the Transport
Package .zip file will be created in your site's core/packages directory.
The final step is to submit that .zip file at <a href="http://modx.com/extras">http://modx.com/extras</a>. You'll need to log in and then click on the &quot;submit a new extra&quot;

Be sure to fill in all the appropriate sections of the submission form and designate the file you attach as a Transport Package. If you have installed the package on your site, there will also be another file with the same name, but without the .zip extension. Be sure to submit the .zip file rather than the other file.

<h2>Avoiding Trouble</h2>
<p>MyComponent is a complex and powerful extra. I've tried to make it difficult to shoot yourself in the foot with it, but you can still do it. Here is one common way. You make some changes to the build files (perhaps adding a new System Setting or changing the fields of a Resource). You rung ImportObjects, but System Settings and Resource fields are not updated in that process. If you later run ExportObjects, you will lose your changes.</p>

<p>There are two ways to avoid this kind of trouble. One is to always add new objects to the Project Config File and run Bootstrap. Then, always make your modifications in MODX rather than the files. That way ExportObjects will always reflect your changes. The second way is to stop using MyComponent at some point in the project and rely solely on the files. You can still run LexiconHelper as needed, but stop running ImportObjects and ExportObjects.</p>

<p>Whatever method you use, it's critical to have a version control system, such as Git, in place. I commit any changes just before running ExportObjects or LexiconHelper, and after running them, do a <fixedpre>git status</fixedpre> and sometimes <fixedpre>git diff</fixedpre> to make sure no unwanted changes have occurred.</p>
