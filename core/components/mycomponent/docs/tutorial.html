<p>Much of the code in this package was inspired by Shaun McCormick's
build scripts for various MODX Revolution components and by the structure
of the MODX Package Manager code.

    <h3>MyComponent 3.0</h3>

    <p>
    MyComponent 3.0 is a much more powerful and convenient version. It installs in a
    different location and uses very different methods than older versions. The best approach
    to upgrading is to uninstall and remove all previous versions before installing 3.0 or newer versions.</p>

    <p>
    The newer versions will require no cut-and-paste operations and no tedious file
    or directory renaming. The only manual operation required is
    editing the project config file.
    </p>

    <p>Here are just some features of the new version</p>

    <p>Based on the objects described in the project config file,
    the new version will: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Bootstrap</b>

            <ul>
                <li>Create all listed objects in MODX</li>
                <li>Create all connections between listed objects (e.g., resources/templates, plugins/events,etc.)</li>
                <li>Add license and header information to all PHP and JS files</li>
                <li>Create the build.transport.php file</li>
                <li>Create code/content files for all objects, to be used in the build </li>
                <li>optionally, make elements static and connect them to their files</li>
                <li>Create core and assets directories and subdirectories</li>
                <li>Create any listed lexicon files</li>
                <li>Write all transport files for the build</li>
                <li>Write all resolver files to connect objects</li>
                <li>Optionally, write skeleton generic resolvers and validators</li>
                <li>Create skeleton class files for all classes</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>ExportObjects</b>

            <ul>
                <li>Find all of the component's objects in MODX</li>
                <li>Create/update code/content files for objects that need one</li>
                <li>Update all transport files, based on the actual objects</li>
                <li>Update all resolver files based on existing connections between objects</li>
            </ul>

                <li>If possible, automatically create or update all lexicon files</li>
                <li>if not, display lexicon string code for pasting</li>
                <li>Audit lexicon files and code files for missing or unused lexicon strings</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>CheckProperties</b>

            <ul>
                <li>Search for scriptProperties usages in your PHP code</li>

                <li>Display code to paste in property file for missing properties</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>General Usage</h2>

    <p>MyComponent installs with a built-in project called Example that you can play with to get familiar with the various MyComponent Utilities. The utilities can be run from the command line, or from inside any good code editor. There is also a User Interface to them that you can see by previewing the &quot;MyComponent&quot; Resources (which executes the MyComponent snippet). The rest of this tutorial will assume that you're using the User Interface, but the principles are the same for the command-line utilities.</p>

    <p>If you view the MyComponent Resource in the front end, you'll see a set of radio buttons, one for each of the MyComponent Utilities, and a Submit button for executing them. Note that as a security precaution, you must be logged in to the Manager in order to use any of the utilities. When you run any of the utilities, a log of the results will appear below the form. You may have to scroll down to see it. </p>

    <h3>The Project Config File</h3>

    <p>Every project used with MyComponent must have its own project config file. The file is always named for the lowercase package name of your Extra: <fixedpre>
        packageNameLower.config.php</fixedpre>. The files are always stored in the <fixedpre> core/components/mycomponent/_build/config</fixedpre> directory. The file for the Example project is called example.config.php. If you look at it now, you'll see all the objects that are part of that package.</p>

    <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
    <p>The Bootstrap utility should always be run at the beginning of any new project, but only after editing the project config file to meet your needs. Bootstrap creates the necessary files and directories for your project and also creates the MODX objects (e.g., snippets, chunks, etc.) specified in the project config file.</p>

    <p>Bootstrap is completely non-destructive. It will not overwrite any existing MODX objects or their code files (though it will update some specific build files). You can re-run Bootstrap at any time during the development of your extra. The usual reason for doing this is discovering that you need another object (a new snippet, chunk, resource, template, etc.) for your project. Add the new object to the project config file and run Bootstrap. MyComponent will create the new object and any necessary files for it to be included in the build.</p>

    <p>It's important to keep your project config file up-to-date with all objects used in your project.</p>

    <p>For a first look, view the MyComponent Resource from the Manager. With the current package set to Example, check the Bootstrap radio
    button in the UI and click on the Submit button. If you scroll down, you should see a log of all the actions performed by the Bootstrap
    utility.</p>

    <p>Follow up by looking at the directories and files created by Bootstrap. They will be in the
    <fixedpre>assets/mycomponents/example/</fixedpre>
    directory. All MyComponent projects will be placed in
    <fixedpre>assets/mycomponents/</fixedpre>
    unless you specify a different target directory in the project config file (not recommended).</p>

    <p>You may notice that a copy of the project config file is placed in the project directory. This is a copy used by the build process,
    but it's not the real project config file and you should never edit it. It is ignored by all the other MyComponent utilities. The real
    project config file (the one used by MyComponent) is always in the
    <fixedpre>core/components/mycomponent/_build/config/</fixedpre>
    directory.</p>

    <p>Once you've looked at all the files and directories created by Bootstrap, go back the the MODX Manager and look at the objects
    created. You should see all the objects specified in the Example project config file. Notice too that the project config file specifies
    a number of characteristics of some of the objects (e.g., parent, template, category, etc.). You should see these relationships in the
    Manager as well.</p>

    <h3>Workflows</h3>
    <h4>New Project</h4>
    <p>If your component is new, you can edit the project config file and run Bootstrap and all your Resources, Elements, and other objects and all necessary files will be created for you. Once the component is finished, you can run ExportObjects and build.transport.php and your Extra will be ready to release.</p>

    <p>If your finished component already exists in MODX, you can edit the project config file and run Bootstrap, ExportObjects, and build.transport.php and your extra will be ready to release.</p>

<h3>Current Version</h3>

<p>This sample build script will build an actual Transport Package
that can be installed in MODX Revolution. It installs a number of
useless resources, elements, menus, system settings, and a
category
called MyComponent. It also creates language strings for elements
and for element properties. The elements have properties with
property descriptions and they're placed in the MyComponent
category.
The resources are placed in a resource group called MyComponent.
The plugins are attached to a couple of system events. In
addition,
there is a script that interacts with the user during the install,
a couple of file resolvers that transfer the assets and core
directories, and a script resolver that does some final work at
the end of the install process. There is also a readme.txt file, a
GPL license file, and a readme.md file for GitHub.</p>

<p>The script is designed so that when you need to create a package,
you can copy it to a directory and modify it to meet your
needs.</p>

<p>No build script could do everything you need for every package, but
this one should handle almost any kind of package you might
want.</p>

<p>Don't be alarmed by the size and complexity of the script. Most of
it will go unused in many packages, and it's easy to make the
script skip things you don't need.</p>

<p>By changing the variables at the top of the build.transport.php
file, you can customize the build script to include just the
components you need. Of course you can also delete the files
and directories you don't need.</p>

<h3>A Proper Transport Package</h3>
<p>In creating a Transport Package, it's not enough to just install
the various pieces of the component. Even a simple snippet
will have properties (parameters). Those properties should usually
be
installed as default properties of the snippet. The properties
also
need descriptions, which should be presented as lexicon strings so
that they can be translated into other languages. Any messages
displayed
by the snippet (e.g., prompts and error messages) should also be
in the
form of MODX lexicon strings.</p>

<p>The snippet also needs a namespace with a corresponding namespace
path so that MODX can find the lexicon strings. In addition, the
snippet and any other
parts of the package should be in a separate category named for
your
package. The files in the package also need to have appropriate
comments
at the top saying who wrote them, what they do, and in the case of
executable files, a short version of the GPL license.</p>

<p>All that sounds a lot more difficult than it is. The MyComponent
package
is designed to make it as easy as possible by providing example
templates for
all the files necessary for a proper package and putting them in
their proper
places on your site.</p>

<p>The assumption is that you will put the files for any MODX add-ons
you
develop under the assets/mycomponents/ directory. When located
there, MODX
will leave them alone during site upgrades and they will not
interfere with
your component when you install it on the same site. MyComponent,
which serves
as an example and a template for each add-on, will be installed in
the
assets/mycomponents/mycomponent/ directory. If you develop an
add-on
called MySnippet, all of its files would then go in the
assets/mycomponents/mysnippet/ directory.</p>

<p>Let's take a quick look at the process of developing an add-on
using MyComponent</p>

<h3>A Brief Overview</h3>
<p>To build a Transport package for a component of your own, you'd
first copy
the mycomponent directory, and all the files under it, to a new
directory under
assets/mycomponents/ and rename it to match the name of your
package.</p>

<p>The next step is to paste your own code into the appropriate files
in the new
directory, then rename them and edit the build.transport.php file
(the script that
actually builds the Transport Package) to meet your needs. You can
do global
search-and-replace operations to change the various strings in the
files, to
match your name, the package name, your site name, your email,
etc.</p>

<p>You'll also need to edit the lexicon files to contain the strings
necessary for your package and edit any validator or resolver
files if
you need them for your package. Don't forget to edit the variables
at the top of the resolver file (like the ones in build.transport.php).</p>

<p>When you run build.transport.php, your package will be created in
the
core/packages directory of your site. The final step is to submit
that
Transport Package .zip file at <a
        href="http://MODXcms.com/extras">http://MODXcms.com/extras</a>
</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Because the MyComponent package builds a package, it can't be
installed directly. It would be missing the _build directory and
it would actually install a number of objects on your site that
you
don't want.</p>

<p>Instead, install the GetMyComponent package in Package Manager.
It will create the the assets/mycomponents directory (a good place
for all your
components) and put the mycomponent directory below that. When you
execute the mycomponent/_build/build.transport.php file, it will
create a transport package called MyComponent and place it in your
core/packages directory. Try that first, and then go to Package
Manager and click on &quot;Add Package&quot; and &quot;Search Locally for
Packages.&quot;</p>

<p>Try installing the MyComponent package and look around for it's
various parts. Then try uninstalling it.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>One of the handiest things you can have is a code editor that will
do multi-file search and replace. You can use that to change
MyComponent to the name of your package (but don't do it yet).</p>

<p>It's particularly handy to have a code editor that will &quot;refactor&quot;
for you. Both NetBeans and JetBrain's PhpStorm will do this. If
you right-click on a file and select refactor -> rename, you can
change the name of the file and the editor will search for all
references to that file in your project and rename them to match.
Always do this before editing the file content.</p>

<p>Most of the components in the MyComponent package have names like
&quot;mychunk1.chunk.tpl,&quot; &quot;mysnippet1.snippet.php,&quot;
&quot;myplugin1.events.php,&quot;
&quot;properties.mysnippet1.php,&quot; etc. You can refactor these to use
the appropriate names for your components and the references to
them in the various files of the project will change to match. If
you
do the search-and-replace operations and the refactoring in the
order
specified later in this tutorial, you should have very little work
left to finish naming everything in the package.</p>

<p>Rather than replacing the existing files with your own, it's almost
always better to paste your own code into the files or edit them
to meet your needs. That way, the PhpDoc comments at the top
of the files will be correct and any necessary GPL license language
will be there as well.
</p>

<h3>Starting a New Package</h3>

<p>It's recommended that you not change anything in the mycomponent
directory, with the exception of the changes you want in all
your packages, e.g., author names, URLs, email addresses,
copyright
notices, etc. Don't change MyComponent.</p>

<p>Once you've made those changes, it's not a bad idea to make it read
only so that you won't modify anything by accident. It's easy to
get confused about where you're working or to accidentally run
search-and-replace or refactor on too many files.
Another good way to protect it is to just put it in a
safe place, far away from your development directory or in a .zip
file.</p>

<p>Start by copying the whole mycomponent directory (or just the parts
of it you need) to a new directory (with a new name) under the
assets/mycomponents directory. Name the directory for your
package.
If you want a package called &quot;BobsPackage,&quot; for example, you'd
create
a directory under assets/mycomponents called bobspackage,
containing
the _build, core, and assets directories and the readme.md
file.</p>
<p>Rename the two mycomponent directories inside your package: core/components/mycomponent and assets/components/mycomponent. Use lowercase
names. You'll have to modify the references in the _build/build.transport.php file to match the changes.</p>

<h3>Do the Renaming and Refactoring</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Start by changing the language string prefix in the language
        files
        with search-and-replace. All the language strings have the mc_
        prefix
        (mc for my component). Change that to an appropriate prefix
        for your
        package. You could use the full name of your package to make
        sure
        there won't be collisions with MODX strings and those of other
        packages.
    </li>

    <li>
        If you didn't do so earlier, do a search-and-replace for Your
        Name
        and replace it with your actual name. Then search for
        http://bobsguides/com
        and replace it with your email address. Search for
        YourGitHubUserName
        and replace it with your GitHub username (if any).
    </li>

    <li>
        Refactor the file names. Change the name of all the elements
        and resources to the names you want to use in your package.
        Watch
        what's happening to make sure that nothing outside your
        package
        is changed. If you're using PhpStorm, be sure to check the
        options
        to search for references and to look in comments and strings.
        Change
        any property file names.
    </li>

    <li>
        Search-and-replace Operations
        <ol>
            <li>Do a case-sensitive global search-and-replace to
                change mycomponent
                to the lowercase name of your package.</li>
            <li>Do another case-sensitive search-and-replace to change
                MyComponent to the camel-case name of
                your component.</li>
            <li>Search for 1/1/11 and change it to the current
                date.</li>
            <li>Search for 2011 and replace it with the current
                year.</li>
            <li>Search for yoursite.com and change it to the domain
                name of your site.</li>
            <li>Check the file paths in the
                _build/data/transport.*.php files.</li>
            <li>Search for Description and add a description for each
                file.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Check the lines that refer to other files in the build.transport.php
        file, and the transport.*.php files to makes sure they match the
        renamed files.</li>
    <li>
        Look through the files to see if anything was missed. In most
        cases,
        you'll get a warning during the build for any path or filename
        references
        that are not correct.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rewrite the readme.txt file. If you use GitHub, rewrite the
        readme.md file. It's in MarkDown format, use the tool at
        <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus">http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus</a>
        to get it to look right before pushing to GitHub. Paste the text of the
        file into the input section at the to and click on the
        &quot;Convert&quot; button. Scroll down to the bottom to see the
        rendered version of the text. If it doesn't look right (and it probably won't),
        edit the text at the top and try again until it looks good, then
        paste it back into your readme.md file.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuring the Build</h3>

<p>Edit the variables at the top of _build/build.transport.php to
set the package name and version and to eliminate the components
that your package doesn't have. You can delete the unwanted files
and directories, or you can leave them there in case your package
gets more complicated in the future. As long as the variables
are set to false, the script will ignore them and they won't be
placed in the package. Edit the variables
at the top of _build/resolvers/install.script.php to meet your
needs.</p>
<p>Here is the list of the variables that you'll need to set:</p>
<ul>
    <li>define('PKG_NAME','MyComponent');</li>
    <li>define('PKG_NAME_LOWER','mycomponent');</li>
    <li>define('PKG_VERSION','1.0.0');</li>
    <li>define('PKG_RELEASE','beta1');</li>
    <li>define('PKG_CATEGORY','MyComponent');</li>
    <br/>
    <li>$hasAssets = true; /* Transfer the files in the assets dir.
        */</li>
    <li>$hasCore = true; /* Transfer the files in the core dir.
        */</li>
    <li>$hasSnippets = true;</li>
    <li>$hasChunks = true;</li>
    <li>$hasTemplates = true;</li>
    <li>$hasResources = true;</li>
    <li>$hasValidator = true; /* Run a validator before installing
        anything */</li>
    <li>$hasResolver = true; /* Run a resolver after installing
        everything */</li>
    <li>$hasSetupOptions = true; /* HTML/PHP script to interact with
        user */</li>
    <li>$hasMenu = true; /* Add items to the MODX Top Menu */</li>
    <li>$hasSettings = true; /* Add new MODX System Settings */</li>
    <li>$hasTemplateVariables = true;</li>
    <li>$hasTemplates = true;</li>
    <li>$hasPlugins = true;</li>
    <li>$hasPluginEvents = true;</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that if you want to connect Template Variables to their
templates or connect plugin events to their plugins, you'll do
that in a resolver (see _build/resolvers/install.script.php).</p>

<h3>Plug In Your Code</h3>

<p>Paste your plugin, template, snippet, resource content, chunk
content, etc. into the appropriate files. After you change each
file,
edit the related _build/data file(s) and lexicon files to
match.</p>

<p>After pasting your snippet code into the *.snippet.php file, for
example, edit the _build/transport.snippets/php file to set
the snippet name and the other snippet fields. Put the appropriate
language strings into the core/lexicon/en/default.inc.php file.
If your snippet (or other element) has default properties, edit
the
appropriate _build/properties file and then add the property strings to
the core/lexicon/en/properties.inc.php file.</p>

<p>Put any class files in the core/model/mycomponent/ directory and
make sure the references to them in any plugin or snippet code
are correct. The correct reference would be something like:</p>
<pre>
MODX_CORE_PATH . components/mycomponents/model/mycomponents/myclass.class.php
</pre>

<p>Edit the transport scripts in the _build/data directory to remove
the sections for items you don't need, correct the fields for
your elements and resources (if any), and correct the paths to
the elements.</p>

<p>Validators run before the package components have been installed.
They're often used to test for necessary items for your package
to run (e.g., a graphics library or another installed element
your package uses, such as getResources).
If you need a validator, edit the code in
_build/validators/preinstall.script.php to meet your needs.</p>

<p>Resolvers run after the package components have been installed.
They
perform operations that aren't done in the install, such as
connecting TVs to their templates, connecting plugin events to
their plugins, setting the values of existing System Settings,
setting
System Settings or properties that depend on the the IDs of
installed
elements or resources (which aren't available during the install),
etc.
If you need a script resolver, edit the code in
_build/resolvers/install.script.php to meet your needs.</p>

<p>Do a global search for Description and edit the description of
each item.</p>

<h3>Run the Build Script</h3>

<p>Execute the _build/build.transport.php script either in your editor
or from the command line. You should see warnings and errors about
anything that is not correct. Fix those.</p>

<h3>Install the Package</h3>

<p>The package will be placed in the core/packages directory (the one
for the main MODX install, not the one in your package).</p>

<p>There is a potential source of confusion here. Let's say your
package
is called yourcomponent. If you install your package in the same
install
of MODX that contains your _build directory, you'll have duplicate
files in</p>
<pre>
    assets/mycomponents/yourcomponent/assets/yourcomponent
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>
    assets/yourcomponent
</pre>
<p>as well as</p>
<pre>
    core/mycomponents/yourcomponent/core/yourcomponent
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>
    core/yourcomponent
</pre>

<p>There's no harm in this, but it's easy to get confused and edit
the wrong file when you're working on the package. One solution
is to install the package a completely separate MODX installation.
The other solution is to be really careful about where you are
when
working on the package.</p>

<p>To install the package, once the transport .zip file has been
copied
to the core/packages directory, go to Package Manager and click on
&quot;Add Package&quot; and &quot;Search
Locally for Packages.&quot; You should see your package in the grid.
Install it and then check to make sure it's all there. Check the
assets/components/yourcomponent and core/components/yourcomponent
directories to make sure the files were transferred.</p>

<p>If you have to modify the build script or any files in the package,
uninstall and remove (force removal) your package. Then you can
run
the build again, copy the .zip file, and try reinstalling.</p>

<h3>Running Your Component</h3>

<p>If you install your component it should run. If you need to
make changes to any parts of it, remember that those changes
won't show up when you run it until you uninstall, rebuild, and
reinstall because MODX is running the version you installed,
not the version you are building.</p>

<p>There's a way around that, thanks to a method developed by
Shaun McCormick, but you have to remember what you're doing or
it's easy to get confused.</p>

<p>If you would like to actually run the code for plugins and snippets
that your build script is packaging, you can create new System
Settings with the paths and URLs for that version. Then in the
code
of your snippets and plugins, get that path with a line like
this:</p>
<pre>
    $path = $MODX->getOption('mc.core_path',null,
        $MODX->getOption('core_path').'components/yourcomponent/');
</pre>
<p>If, for example, you set the mc.core_path system setting to:</p>
<pre>
{assets_path}components/yourcomponent/core/components/yourcomponent/
</pre>
<p>You can load your class file in the snippet with code like
this:</p>
<pre>
$iFile = $path . "model/yourcomponent/yourclass.inc.php";
require_once $iFile;
</pre>
<p>For you, the path will resolve to the area with your build script.
For others who install the package, however, the system setting
will come back empty, so the path will resolve to that of the
installed component.</p>

<p>You can also replace the snippet and plugin code with something
like this:</p>
<pre>
    return include $MODX->getOption('mc.core_path') .
        'core/components/yourcomponent/elements/snippets/yoursnippet.snippet.php';
</pre>
<p>If you do this, however, don't forget that you are running off
the build files. If any files are missing or mis-referenced in the
build script, you won't know about it until you run your
component in a MODX install that doesn't have the system
settings.</p>

<p>If that's all too confusing, just skip it and remember to
uninstall,
build, and install your package each time you make a change.</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Package</h3>
<p>As we said earlier, when you run build.transport.php the Transport
Package
.zip file will be created in your site's core/packages directory.
The final step
is to submit that .zip file at <a
        href="http://MODXcms.com/extras">http://MODXcms.com/extras</a>.
You'll need to log in and then click on the &quot;submit a new extra&quot;
link.</p>

<p>
Be sure to fill in all the appropriate sections of the submission
form and designate the
file you attach as a Transport Package. If you have installed the
package on
your site, there will also be another file with the same name, but
without
the .zip extension. Be sure to submit the .zip file rather than
the other file.
