MyComponent is a generic build script for MODx Revolution components.
Much of the code in this component was written by Shaun McCormick or patterned
after his code.

Because MyComponent is itself a build script, it can't be installed directly
through package Manager. You can download the files using the download link
on this page, but a better method is to install the GetMyComponent package,
which will install the files for you.
